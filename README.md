# **React Portfolio** #

Hello and welcome to my React Portfolio section, here you will find some projects that I developed which most of them for self-learning and study purposes so feel free to explore them. 
I hope you enjoy it !

# **About the projects** #

**It is important to say that the projects MyReads and Readble are React projects and MobileFlashcards is a React Native project.**

In order to have a better visualization I created this repository to group/migrate my React projects into a single repository but the original repos still exist separately. Each folder contains a functional project and everything you need to build them, but if you still want to clone the original repos you can find them according the following list:

- [Myreads project](https://github.com/walternunes/My-reads)
- [Readble project](https://github.com/walternunes/Readble)
- [MobileFlahscards project](https://github.com/walternunes/Mobile-Flahscards)
